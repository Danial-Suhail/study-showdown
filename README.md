Study Showdown incentivizes staying on track with your studying by tracking the sites each user visits in a given period. Study Showdown does this by logging tab activity on Google Chrome, as its a Chrome Extension that connects to a NextJS website. By staying on studying and productivity-based domains like KhanAcademy, you earn points, and by going on unproductive websites, you lose points. At the end of the period, your points are calculated for that session and ranked amongst other users on a global leaderboard!
